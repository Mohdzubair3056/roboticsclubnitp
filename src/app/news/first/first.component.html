    For once, 3D printing might seem surreal to a lot of people. All you need to do is to feed the
    dimensions of the
    structure which you wish to produce and the printer will produce the same . 90’s kids might even compare
    it with the
    shaka laka boom boom pencil – or an elementary version of it.You know that a technology is worth
    noticing when the
    president of united states mentions it! In his 2013 state of the union address, Obama praises 3D
    printing as having ”the
    potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything.”<br />
    Now, you might be wondering what 3D printing actually is. And why is so much fuss surrounding it. Well,
    the technology
    isn’t any rocket science and is quite straight forward .What is being done is that the machine is
    putting down layers in
    a definite way and those layers add up to form the required object.Each of these layers can be seen as a
    part of
    horizontal cross section of the object.<br />
    Despite working on such a basic principle, 3D printing is one the most promising technologies which can
    change the world
    upside down. It has enormous applications in medical sector, from surgeries to medications to
    prosthetics.<br />
    3D printing can also play a major role in manufacturing sector. Production will take a turn towards the
    local. As the
    prices will drop and its applications will increase, more goods will be manufactured close to their
    point of purchase in
    small plants. It will eliminate the shipping cost resulting in cost cutting. This might also boost the
    household<br />
    industries. Also, customized goods would become the new trend as alteration of goods would be easier.
    This might even
    alter the economy of one of our neighbouring countries as china’s economy depends on being able to
    provide a cheap labor
    pool for manufacturing.<br />
    Don’t know what lies in the future as 3D printing is reaching to a big audience now.
